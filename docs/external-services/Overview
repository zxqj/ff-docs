# Sleeper

Sleeper has a public API, which apparently has changed quite a bit over the past few years.  It requires no authentication and is all HTTP GET requests and JSON responses.  I will document some of it here as I write code against it/find functions that are useful.  It is pretty well documented, but there are some notable absences.  Several people have written API wrappers around it; I'm doubting those would save very much time.

But the frontend uses some additional APIs they have which are not public.
