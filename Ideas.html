<p>This is where I dump ideas, so there may be some redundancies.</p>
<h2 id="use-case-driven-uis">Use-Case Driven UIs</h2>
<h3 id="mid-season-draft-tool"><em>Mid-Season Draft Tool</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>“all-players-ranked roster-highlighted UI” but modified so that each
row allows some extra info to be displayed, including one or more of
<ul>
<li>some summary representation of several player ranking measures</li>
<li>a small message or number conveying extremely salient contextual
information (injured: projected return date, teammate projected return
date)</li>
<li>would-be-if-drafted team measures, or</li>
<li>the difference between <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em>(<em>T</em>)</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em>(<em>T</em> − {<em>p</em>})</span> (where
<span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> is user’s team and <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> is the player) for
currently-selected measure <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>,
or</li>
<li>a summary representation of the above-defined difference for
multiple measures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clicking on a player will display a pop-up with details
<ul>
<li>performance stats for season games to date</li>
<li>additional contextual fields in each row of game data - roster,
quarterback, target share</li>
<li>Potentially also some creative “timeline” display against it,
showing team states and their duration.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trade-tools">Trade Tools</h3>
<h4 id="trade-manual-analysis"><em>Trade Manual Analysis</em></h4>
<p>Could be integrated into League Team - Matchup UI. We want to show
comparison of two values: <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em>(<em>t</em><sub>0</sub>)</span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em>(<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>)</span>, where
<span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> is the currently-selected
measure, <span class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub>0</sub></span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>t</em><sub>1</sub></span> are user’s team
before and after the trade, respectively.</p>
<h4 id="trade-finder"><em>Trade Finder</em></h4>
<p>Search league for trade that would optimize some user-specified
objective function <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>X</em>)</span> and satisfy a set of
user-specified constraints <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>X</em>) &lt; <em>c</em><sub>1</sub>, ..., <em>g</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>(<em>X</em>) &lt; <em>c</em><sub><em>n</em></sub></span>,
<span class="math inline"><em>X</em> ∈ <em>D</em></span>. We could
define the feasible set <span class="math inline"><em>D</em></span> in
multiple ways, but for the moment let <span
class="math inline"><em>X</em></span> be some matrix representation of
both teams’ before and after states. (Obviously, the UI will enable the
user to specify these in a more intuitive way. No mathematical
optimization experience required.) For example</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“mutually advantageous”</p>
<ul>
<li>objective function: <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>X</em>) = <em>g</em><em>a</em><em>i</em><em>n</em>(<em>t</em><sub><em>u</em><em>s</em><em>e</em><em>r</em></sub>,</span><code>trade</code><span
class="math inline">)</span></li>
<li>constraints: <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em><em>a</em><em>i</em><em>n</em>(<em>t</em><sub><em>o</em><em>p</em><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>e</em><em>n</em><em>t</em></sub>,</span><code>trade</code><span
class="math inline">) &gt; 0</span>,</li>
<li>where <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em><em>a</em><em>i</em><em>n</em>(<em>t</em>,</span><code>trade</code><span
class="math inline">)</span> is how many more fantasy points team <span
class="math inline"><em>t</em></span> is projected to score,
rest-of-season, after making <code>trade</code>. (where we consider
<code>trade</code> to be a function over the collection of sets of
players, <span
class="math inline"><em>g</em><em>a</em><em>i</em><em>n</em>(<em>t</em>, <em>f</em>) = <em>p</em>(<em>f</em>(<em>t</em>)) − <em>p</em>(<em>t</em>)</span>
where <span class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> is the trade and <span
class="math inline"><em>p</em></span> is projected rest-of-season
fantasy points.)</li>
<li>i.e. maximize our benefit whilst still being beneficial to the other
team.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>“maximizing difference between apparent and actual opponent-team
gain”</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g.
<ul>
<li>apparent: free rankings provided online that don’t take into account
league settings</li>
<li>actual: projected points using league settings</li>
<li>this wouldn’t be a great thing to optimize, but would be interesting
to see. A better set up would be “maximize actual user-team gain while
keeping apparent opponent-team gain over a minimum threshold”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll have to show the above defined optimization problem can be
solved, or approximated to some degree of tolerance, reasonably
efficiently. On second thought, it might be best to think of the
criteria/constraints ourselves and give the user a set of pre-defined
options. Or just present the trades we find using our hard-coded
optimization problems to the user. I do think an easy-to-understand
(potentially simplified) explanation of what was optimized would be very
beneficial.</p>
<h4 id="trade-retrospective"><em>Trade Retrospective</em></h4>
<p>This would be a <em>great</em> way to draw people to site. Go through
past trades and enable evaluation of their fairness/quality based on</p>
<ul>

<li>how they actually affected teams afterwards</li>
