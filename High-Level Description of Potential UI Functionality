 ## Player
 We want to have a page that conveys a lot of information about a player at one
 time, including
 
* how that player's projections have been trending over the last week
* their performance history
    * raw performance metrics
    * fantasy points, using league settings
* context for past performances - Look into timeline UIs  
    * their injuries (obviously)
    * teammates' injuries
    * team roster changes
    * strength of matchups
* performance projections
    * stats projections
    * ScoringConfig (stats projections) -> fantasy projections
* context for future
    * returning teammates
    * strength of matchups

## NFL Teams
* fantasy points and stats allowed - to position - drill down into wide receiver types
* fantasy points and stats allowed - to play type - short/long pass, qb rush
* fantasy points and stats allowed - to (passing, rushing, receiving)
* defensive roster changes

## League Teams
* 2-Team Comparison of current players' past performance
* 2-Team Comparison of current players' projected performance
* Able to change ranking measure for each of listed UIs
    * ranking measures
        * (past/projected performance) by (points/stats)
        * projected performance add'l inputs
            * can use raw-rankings projections for standard-scoring (PPR/HALF/STD), as there 
            are *a lot* more opinions available than with stats projections
            * next week/ROS
    * UIs
        * "all-players-ranked roster-highlighted UI"
        * "Matchup" UI with players' values next to them, and totals at op
            * some sort of summary comparison

## Use-Case Driven UIs
Under "player" above, was somewhat driven by wanting a draft UI, so there may be some overlap

### Mid-Season Draft Tool


### Trade tool
Could be integrated into League Team - Matchup UI.  We want to compare selected measure over 
whole team with each set of players.
