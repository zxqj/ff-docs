    "# Scoring Settings\n",
    "## Available Settings\n",
    "### Sleeper\n",
    "There are 13, 8, 16, 20, 40, and 6 configurable settings in the Sleeper UI for Passing, Rushing, Receiving, Kicking, Defense, and Special Teams (Team), respectively.  There are 3 \"miscellaneous\" and 14 \"bonus\" settings.  Finally, there are 6 Special Teams (Player) settings, and 21 IDP settings.  All of the bonus and miscellaneous settings apply to teams with only offensive player roles.  I believe that, of the 6 Special Teams (Player) settings, 4 of them are probably regular point contributors to players occupying offensive fantasy roster slots (`player td`, `fumble recovery`, `punt return yards`, `kick return yards` - though the first two are somewhat rare).  `forced fumble` and `solo tackle` would be exceedingly rare and would mostly only happen if the returner fumbled the ball and did something about it himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives 13+8+16+20+40+6+3+14+4 + (very rarely)2 = 118-120 settings for rosters with no defensive players, and 141 settings total.\n",

    "Points listed immediately after the setting, not in parentheses, are the defaults for PPR.  Otherwise, the setting contributes 0 points by default.\n",
