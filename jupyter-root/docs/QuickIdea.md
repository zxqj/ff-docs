### Applies to Player Stats UI, Player Strengh-of-Schedule UI, or NFL Team Analysis UI
* Numbers shown with some visual indicator of their "trustworthiness", when it is clear that
    the user is using the number to evaluate a player or team defense
* Low-trustworthiness format includes on-hover extra info (or press-and-hold for mobile)

### Examples
1. 
    * **Number Field**: game fantasy pts.
    * **Complicating Factor**: the number includes a non-negligible proportion of production in <i>garbage time</i>, which I will heretofore attempt to more rigorously define.


        *garbage time* - high proportion earned late in game when score difference was high
