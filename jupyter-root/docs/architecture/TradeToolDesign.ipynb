Let's just do a calculation of total starting-lineup fantasy points and see how that would work."

    "The simplest method might be to use $-x$, where $x$ is the average rest-of-season ranking from a bunch of different sources. This would fail to take into account the league's settings, however.  In order to do this, we would need stats projections for the rest of the season.  Would we want to use game-by-game projections and add them up?  By `Roster`, we mean, the *whole* league Roster, including the bench.  So, technically, a calculation of the team's performance would *require* game-by-game statistics, in order to determine the starting lineup for any given week.  If we just maximize the total projected fantasy points for the rest of the season for all players, would that put us in a drastically different place?  It definitely could.  Think of someone with a very unbalanced roster.  So that is not an option."
