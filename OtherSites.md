These sites will often have many tools.  Below I'm just listing the ones that were interesting.

* `Money talk` - My team rank: 7th(full) 5th(starting)
* Trade database - search for trades by sets of players.  Claims to have 3,000,000 trades; however, my query for all trades of Breece Hall returned 49 results.  So that figure must be for all past seasons, if it's not completely made up (I'm leaning toward it being completely made up).  Still, this is a cool feature.
* There are only two ranking measures used for players - dynasty and redraft value.  Which is a number in the 20k to 100k range whose actual meaning is unclear.  Can't find definition.  I think I saw a link to it earlier.
* Enables you to rank teams by starting roster and full roster
* The team comparison that looks like "fantasy-pros-waiver-wire view" is useful.  I think fantasy pros might also have this.
