These sites will often have many tools.  Below I'm just listing the ones that were interesting.

# fantasycalc.com
* `Money talk` - My team rank: 7th(full) 5th(starting)
* Trade database - search for trades by sets of players.  Claims to have 3,000,000 trades; however, my query for all trades of Breece Hall returned 49 results.  So that figure must be for all past seasons, if it's not completely made up (I'm leaning toward it being completely made up).  Still, this is a cool feature.
* There are only two ranking measures used for players - dynasty and redraft value.  Which is a number in the 20k to 100k range whose actual meaning is unclear.  Can't find definition.  I think I saw a link to it earlier.
* Enables you to rank teams by starting roster and full roster
* The team comparison that looks like "fantasy-pros-waiver-wire view" is useful.  I think fantasy pros might also have this.

# fantasyfootballranker.com
* `Money talk` - My team rank: 8th
* Just ranks teams with a dynasty and redraft measure.
* Also not a fan of the colors/overall look and feel of the UI.  

# cheatsheetking.com
* Very unclear how to use, and it's broken in several ways.
* `Add` button is presumably supposed to enable one to type in a player and add it to their sheet.  The search does not return all players which match the query.  (e.g. (resultSet "James") does not include James Cook).
* From what I can tell, a cheatsheet is a ranking of players?  It does not give you a very efficient way of sorting or moving them.  Limited to Drag and Drop.  You can ctrl+click multiple players within a position category, but your selections are lost when you change to another position. 

# Fantasylife.com
* offers a fuckton of tools behind a paywall

# Footballguys.com
* Offers 5-10 different stat projects + draftkings and fanduel projections
